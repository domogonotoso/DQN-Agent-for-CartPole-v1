## Cartpole, what is it?
! [videos/rl-video-episode-0.mp4]
Don't let stick on the cart fall down.


## MDP (Markov Decision process)
What happened at past doesn't effect on what will happen from now.

## Bellman equation
Q(s, a) = r + gamma * max_a' Q(s', a')


## Policy diffusion at maze


## From falling down, think how q_network is changed. About q-value.

## Replay buffer
 put graph image that I've seen before, that why it is good.



## Revision
    if episode % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Episode {episode}, Reward: {episode_reward}, Epsilon: {agent.epsilon:.3f}")  

to  

if episode % 10 == 0:
    avg_reward = np.mean(reward_history[-10:])
    print(f"Episode {episode}, Reward: {episode_reward:.1f}, "
          f"10-episode avg: {avg_reward:.1f}, Epsilon: {agent.epsilon:.3f}")


## Tuning hyperparameter

## Debuging test.py
Episode 1, Reward: 500.0
Episode 2, Reward: 500.0
Episode 3, Reward: 500.0
Episode 4, Reward: 500.0
Episode 5, Reward: 500.0
Episode 6, Reward: 500.0
Episode 7, Reward: 500.0
Episode 8, Reward: 500.0
Episode 9, Reward: 500.0
Episode 10, Reward: 500.0

Too good. I think it has some problem. So I add checking code.

step += 1
    print(f"Episode {episode}, Reward: {total_reward}, Steps: {step}")
