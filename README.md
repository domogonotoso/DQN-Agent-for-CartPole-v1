## Cartpole, what is it?
Don't let stick on the cart fall down.


## MDP (Markov Decision process)

## Bellman equation



## Policy diffusion at maze


## From falling down, think how q_network is changed. About q-value.

## Replay buffer
 put graph image that I've seen before, that why it is good.
